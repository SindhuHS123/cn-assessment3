x=8(usn 078)+10=18
y=x//2=9

machine A address; 192.168.5.1
machine B address; 10.0.9.15
machine C; www.google.com

iptables -A INPUT -m limit --limit 42/min --limit-burst 6 -p icmp --icmp-type echo-reply-s 192.168.56.1 -j 
DROP(typed in machine B)


 The above command uses j drop to drop packets which are appended 
to input chain,and are of type echo reply coming from source -192.168.56.1

.A new token in generated every 60/42=1.43sec(approx.).
j DROP drops the packet.



As tokens are generated at rate 1 token per 1.43seconds and the burst is filled with
 token in the starting that means that 6 tokens are available at very first second.

first 16 packets(16seconds) are dropped as atleast one token is available at that time.

at 18 second 18 tockens are avialable(6+(18/1.43)) so first 18 packets are dropped but 
at 19th second no token is available. hence 19 th is accepted then 23rd packet is accepted.
