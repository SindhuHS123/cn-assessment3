linux commands

-A RH -firewall -l -input -p icmp --icmp-
type echp -request -m limit --limit 11/ s--limit -burst 3 j- ACCEPT

these rules are designed to allow incoming ping requests with limit 1/8 one per second

--limit; specifies the rate at what tokens get refilled into the bucket 4/hour means 4tokens per hour(1 token every 15 mins)

--limit -burst; specifies the maximum amount of tokens can be filled in the bucket (this is also the amount of tokens the bucket states out with)

the limit-burst argument specifies the number of matter that are allow through before the limit of 1 per sec "kicks in" these two rules both apply only to ICMP echo request
packets (incoming PING requests) these are not perhost limits and apply to anything the rule matches(which in this case would be all ICMP echo requests)

so for the second rule it will allow rep to 8 icmp echo request packet(nomatter how quickly they"'re recieved ) and the only allow 1 icmp packet per second after that (regardles
of wich host the request is coming from)?
at what point docs iptable reset and allow a burst of rep three packets again

      we learnt about the linux/unix commands through and got ideam of it and how to calculate the burst rate and output rate and how the leaky bucket works.
